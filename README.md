# C4 - multi repo diagrams for microservices with dsl (WIP)

This repository contains an example of how you could organize a C4 diagram with the help of structurizr out of multiple repositories.

More details you can find under the following blog article (link will be added here.)

## Start Structurizr
I have added a docker compose setup to start structurizr lite from the diagrams.
